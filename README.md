# hello-world
I am writing here to connect with more experience programmers and bioinformaticians. I'm trying to get my lab set up with some solid mysql databases as well learn/improve on analyzing our NextGen sequencing data with open source programs such as stacks. I want to be able to problem solve and improve our biodata analysis, from LIMS systems to running analyses through R.
